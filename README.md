# Assessing additional emission reductions and removals through improved forest management


#### Use code to assess approaches in additional emission reduction and removal estimates in IFM carbon accounting 
Step 1: Assess historical U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data to define the business-as-usual.
Step 2: Run predictive growth and yield models in the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) to estimate gross additional emission reductions and removals over the typical contract length of 15-years and compare to assessming measured plots in FIA over the same 15 year time period. 
Step 3: Compare measured vs modeled, static vs dynamic, and composite/blended vs 100% harvest likelihood in the BAU

### Here we assess four major regions for Maple / Beech / Birch and Oak / Hickory forest type groups:
#### 1) Northeast - Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont
#### 2) Central Appalachians - Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia
#### 3) Southern Appalachians - Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia
#### 4) Northwoods - Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin
