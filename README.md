# Assessing additional emission reductions and removals through improved forest management


#### Use code to conservatively estimate additional emission reductions and removals in carbon accounting 
Step 1: Assess historical U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data to define the business-as-usual.
Step 2: Run predictive growth and yield models in the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) to estimate gross additional emission reductions and removals over the typical contract length of 20-years. 
Step 3: Identify parcels most likely to harvest over the next 20 years to ensure and enhance additional emission reductions and removals.

### Here we assess four major regions:
#### 1) Northeast - Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont
#### 2) Central Appalachians - Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia
#### 3) Southern Appalachians - Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia
#### 4) Northwoods - Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin


## Future Directions
#### 1a) Dynamic Baseline Paper - using historic FIA data, mock up what dynamic crediting would actually look like
#### 1b) Dynamic Baseline Paper - could we also leverage FVS and show what static vs dynamic baselining would look like or would this more be static vs composite
#### 2) Compare crediting for one example project across two methodologies e.g., UT project comparing ACR to VM0045
