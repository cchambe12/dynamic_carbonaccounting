# Assessing additional emission reductions and removals through improved forest management


#### Use code to conservatively estimate additional emission reductions and removals in carbon accounting 
Step 1: Assess historical U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data to define the business-as-usual.
Step 2: Run predictive growth and yield models in the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) to estimate gross additional emission reductions and removals over the typical contract length of 20-years. 
Step 3: Identify parcels most likely to harvest over the next 20 years to ensure and enhance additional emission reductions and removals.
